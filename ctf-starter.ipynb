For each challenges, there is a prompt to help guide your thinking toward solving the challenge, and a web request to help interact with the the model or flag server. Each challenge is unique, but you will be able to use the same code with in levels - Granny 2 is an evolution of Granny and so on. Challenges generate a unique flag - so don't share them, flags will be obvious and will begin with the following pattern `gAAAAABl`. \n\nUse the starting `query` function provided to interact with the challenge. This is the only endpoint and scanning for other paths or services is not necessary. You should build your solutions and strategies around these web requests. Errors try to be helpful and nudge you in the right direction.\n\nTo start, run the sample request manually, read the error or prompt, and start modifying your inputs until a flag falls out.
